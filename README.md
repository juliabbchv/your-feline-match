## Overview

As a cat enthusiast without a cat of my own, I’ve always wondered which feline would be the perfect fit for my lifestyle. As an aspiring developer, I decided to combine my passion with my skills by creating a tool that helps users discover their ideal cat based on a fun, quick quiz. This project is a work-in-progress, where I’m actively applying the concepts I’m learning to build a functional and engaging web app.
